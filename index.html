            <p>This is a single-player puzzle derived from the rules of chess, played on a 4x4 board. Starting with white,
            play alternates between moving a white and then a black piece. Every move must capture
            a piece of the opposing colour. Pieces move just like in chess, but there is no
            check. To successfully solve the puzzle, capture every piece leaving behind
            only the white king.</p>
            <p>The initial configuration is a random permutation of the 16 pieces of a normal
            chess set, with pawns excluded.</p>
            <p>Open questions include: What is the total number of unique starting positions? Is every starting position solvable? If not, what proportion are solvable? Is there a quick way to prove whether a position is solvable without actually solving it? Is there a deterministic solving algorithm that doesn't need any brute force search?</p>
